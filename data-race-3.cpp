//Move semantics and uniqueness
//  As with the above-mentioned copy constructor, passing by value is usually safe - provided that a deep copy is made of all the data structures within the object that is to be passed. With move semantics , we can additionally use the notion of uniqueness to prevent data races by default. In the following example, a unique_pointer instead of a raw pointer is used for the string member in the Vehicle class.
//  As can be seen, the std::string has now been changed to a unique pointer, which means that only a single reference to the memory location it points to is allowed. Accordingly, the move constructor transfers the unique pointer to the worker by using std::move and thus invalidates the pointer in the main thread. When calling v0.getName(), an exception is thrown, making it clear to the programmer that accessing the data at this point is not permissible - which is the whole point of using a unique pointer here as a data race will now be effectively prevented.
//  The point of this example has been to illustrate that move semantics on its own is not enough to avoid data races. The key to thread safety is to use move semantics in conjunction with uniqueness. It is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that pointers to objects that are moved between threads are unique.
